# Personal Finance Tracker
This project is a Python application designed to help users manage their personal finances efficiently. It incorporates a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for core transaction management and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for enhanced sorting and visualization. The application leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and JSON-based data storage for robust functionality.

## Features
### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

**Transaction Management:**
Add new transactions, update existing ones, and delete transactions.
View transaction summaries, including the maximum transaction amount.
Bulk read transactions from an external file.

**Persistent Data Storage:**
All transactions are saved and retrieved from a JSON file.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
**Transaction Sorting:**
Sort transactions by Date, Category, or Amount in ascending or descending order.

**Dynamic Table View:**
Displays transactions in a scrollable, interactive table.

## Technologies Used
**Programming Language:** Python

**CLI:** Built using standard Python libraries.

**GUI Framework:** Tkinter

**Data Format:** JSON

**OOP Principles:** Applied throughout for better code organization and reusability.
